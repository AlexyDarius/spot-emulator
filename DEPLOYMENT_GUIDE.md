## 🔧 Fix for 404 Error

The 404 error you're seeing is because Vercel needs to be redeployed with the new file structure. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. **Redeploy to Vercel**
```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or push to GitHub if connected to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "Fix client script endpoint"
git push
```

### 2. **Verify File Structure**
Make sure you have these files:
```
spot-emulator/
├── api/
│   ├── spot-emulator.js           # Main API
│   └── spot-emulator-client.js    # Client script endpoint
├── index.html                     # Web interface
├── vercel.json                    # Vercel config
└── README.md                      # Documentation
```

### 3. **Test the Endpoints**
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/` - Web interface
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spot-emulator` - XML feed
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spot-emulator-client.js` - Client script
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spot-emulator/status` - Status JSON

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to your Vercel project
   - Check the "Functions" tab
   - Verify both API files are listed

2. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Look for any build errors
   - Ensure all files are being uploaded

3. **Manual Test**
   ```bash
   # Test the client script endpoint
   curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spot-emulator-client.js
   
   # Should return JavaScript code, not 404
   ```

### If the client script loads but emulator doesn't start:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Verify `window.spotEmulator` is defined

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Ensure `/api/spot-emulator/sync` calls are working
   - Look for any failed requests

## ✅ Expected Behavior

After successful deployment:

1. **Web Interface Loads**: Beautiful interface with real-time updates
2. **Client Script Loads**: No 404 errors in console
3. **Movement Starts**: Position updates every second
4. **Sync Works**: Server receives position updates every 5 seconds
5. **XML Feed Works**: Continuous SPOT feed without restarts

## 🎯 Success Indicators

- ✅ No 404 errors in browser console
- ✅ "🚀 SPOT Emulator Client started" in logs
- ✅ Position coordinates updating in real-time
- ✅ "📍 Track message synced with server" messages
- ✅ XML feed shows continuous movement

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. **Check the Vercel deployment logs** for any build errors
2. **Verify the file paths** match exactly
3. **Try a fresh deployment** by pushing to a new branch
4. **Check browser compatibility** (modern browsers only)

**🎉 Once deployed correctly, you'll have a fully functional SPOT emulator that never restarts!**
